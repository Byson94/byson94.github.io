Hello there!

I made this website so that I can post about project's that I am working on and also write blogs about them! I am pretty commited to making many projects so I will be posting more here from time to time.

Since, I dont have much to talk about anything here, let me tell you more about how I got into software development.

It was in early 2024 that I made my first software. It was a [2D game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics) about shooting things and then gaining powerups from it. I made this game using [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) an open-source game engine which required no code to make games. It was like a great base that helped me understand a lot of things and move forward low level programming.

Back then, making games were tough for me even though [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) was a great engine that required absolutely no code and used visual coding to make games - similar to scratch. I am a pretty tenacious person so I continued to make games even though I struggled badly and the games looked and felt bad as well.

Over time, I slowly got better at making games and I went as far as to making chess with a 1800+ [ELO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) rated AI in [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/). But unfortunately that didn't last long because I accidentally deleted [grub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB) from my linux mint setup. Luckly I managed to recover my system, but the files of the chess game I made in [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) were lost. I was devastated by this because I spend so much hours on it and coding the entire game once again might take me ages because since [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) is more for visual programming, I had to manually make the UI with sprites, meaning that I had to create a chessboard and then fill its entire 64 squares with chess pieces. Even though I still had the code of the 1800 [ELO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) rated AI, I lost the entire code that bridged the gap between vanilla js and [gdjs](https://docs.gdevelop.io/GDJS%20Runtime%20Documentation/modules/gdjs.html) (GDevelops JavaScript API).

Due to this devastating loss, I took a break from making games for a while. I did come back a few days later to make a new game but all those are not important because after this incident, I slowly started to move away from making games with [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) mainly because I lost interest and also because of the fact that its pretty limited for more complex things that I wanted to make.

So, by late 2024, I fully stopped making games with [Gdevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) and moved forward to making websites.
Don't get me wrong, I actually didn't like the period where I used to make websites mainly because of the fact that I suck at front end development and also because of the fact that I used [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) to give me code which I just copy pasted. At that time, I was like a brain dead human copy pasting code without activating a single one of my brains neurons for finding what the bug is.

I would say that the first project that I ever did without the help of AI was a `git clone`. I researched about git underlying architecture and only used AI for learning more about how git stores commit and how git's file structure works.

Because of that, I did mostly break free from this habit I created during my early programming career but I still have imposter syndromes and sometimes feel that I need AI validation for the code I write.

So, if you are someone who is new to programming, I suggest that you dont touch AI at all! Be wise and only use it when you are stuck. From my experience, I would say that **AI hell** is a way lot worse that what **tutorial hell** is.

Yeah, that I guess that sums it up. This is the story of how I got into software development. If anyone is reading this, I hope that you had a great time or maybe found this useful and thank you for sparing your valuable time for reading my fun little story. Have a great day!
