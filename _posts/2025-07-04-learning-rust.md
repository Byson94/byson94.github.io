Hey there! Welcome to another blog of mine. Today I am here to talk about my progress in learning rust and what I think of the language in general.

So, I have been using rust - not in a direct way but using it based on what little things I knew (functions, variables, printing, importing etc.) and also copying code from the internet. And I have to admit that I hated it. I wanted to learn rust fully but was intimidated by its learning curve.

But, due to a 3AM motivation, I actually managed to get myself to learn rust and I somehow found interest in it!

You see, I am not a type of person to have fun while reading something but for some reason, I loved reading and learning using [the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). I had no words except the fact that the documentation was fantastic! It helped me understand the basics of rust in no time!

So, now that I am kinda good at rust, I'll talk about my experience and what I think of rust.

### The learning curve

It's hard in the beginning but once you know the fundamentals, everything else will go smooth thereafter.

### The resources

Rust has a lot of resources to get you started aswell as explaining how each library works.

### The compiler

The rust compiler is pretty awesome! I like how it points to the exact errors and also provides information on the error that we encountered.

### Great for complete beginners?

I would say that its both great and bad for beginners. When I started learning rust, I actually knew other languages so it was easy for me to pick up its syntaax. But if an average person with no prior programming experience wanted to learn rust, I wont think that they will be able to pick things up quick.

But, it is upto you that decides if you will learn rust or any other low level languages like [c](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>).

### What did I learn from this?

I actually learnt a ton of things! I actually reached [chapter 5 in the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html) in 2 days!

And moreover, I am now capable of making intermediate projects on my own! Though it is important to mention that I am still learning rust and I have to learn a lot of things new like enums and structs, I would say that the journey till here was smooth! I did get overwhelmed by [chapter 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html) and [chapter 4](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html) a bit, but with some extra research and trying their examples provided in each chapters, I managed to move through the hassle and learn a lot.

### What are my current rust based projects?

Now that I know rust fundamentals, I am now be doing rust projects using [this greeksforgreeks blog](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/rust-projects/) to as a reference to get project ideas.

### Real reason why I started to learn rust

The real reason why I started to learn rust in the first place was to make a project which I wanted to make for a long time. A [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager) for [linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). And since I was so bad at low level programming, I had to learn a compiled language and rust is what I wanted to learn at the end due to several other factors.

Even thought I could have went with something like [c](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>), the safety that rust provides was too good that I couldn't pass.

And, if you are someone who wants to learn rust, I would suggest [the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) as the best option, because it explains all details about rust fundamentals that we need to know to get started with rust.
