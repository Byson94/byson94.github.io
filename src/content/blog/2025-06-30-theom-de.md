## Introduction

Hello everyone, welcome to another post of mine.

Today, I am going to talk about a new project that I am currently working. It's called Theom.

Recently, I have found a pretty interesting project called [AxOS](https://www.axos-project.com). It is a small Linux distribution built on top of arch Linux. Because of the fact that I love Unix based systems so much, I wanted to contribute to [AxOS](https://www.axos-project.com) anyhow. And I found my answer to it pretty quick.

See, one of the main specialities of [AxOS](https://www.axos-project.com) are the desktops that are built upon different window managers and configuired so much that it can be considered desktop environment. So, I had a thought. What if I make my own desktop environment as a contribution to [AxOS](https://www.axos-project.com)? I can actually learn a ton of things from a project like this! And so I asked the developer of [AxOS](https://www.axos-project.com) if I could contribute a new desktop environment to [AxOS](https://www.axos-project.com) and he agreed.

So, I have been working on this Desktop Enviornment for the past 2 months and I would say that it is pretty great and functional now.

## Features

Let me now talk about a features of **Theom:**

#### **Customisability:**

Theom is extremely customisable from the top down due to it's decentralised nature of window manager configuration files.

#### **Stability:**

Theom is pretty stable because it stands on the shoulders of i3wm.

#### **Polished UI/UX:**

Theom has a pretty polished UI and UX.

#### **Compatibility:**

Theom is compatible due to the two modes that theom's compositor has. Performance and compatibility modes. Performance mode is recommended on most modern systems because performance mode is light and does the job very well. But compatibility mode is heavy but provides compatibility to old hardwars and Virtual machines.

#### **Unix like philosophy:**

Theom strictly follows the unix philosophy of providing maximum freedom at the cost of self maintainance. Theom will work perfectly fine out of the box, but when you start to customize it, you will notice that there are no apparent safety nets and that theom trust's the user to do it all by themself.
